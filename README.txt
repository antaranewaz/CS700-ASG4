The program makes use a sorting algorithm called Shaker Sort (Cocktail-Shaker Sort), which is a derived version of Bubble Sort, 
and sorts an array of randomly generated numbers to ascending and descending form. The program also calculates the time taken to 
sort the numbers. 

A file gets created with the randomly generated numbers. Then each sorting function (ascending and descending) reads the file, sorts and 
creates two new files for the ascending sort and descending sort.
